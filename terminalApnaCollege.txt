ls -> list files (shows all files);
pwd (print directory folder)->returns the working directory
cd --> change directory 
when we want to move back to the folder then cd .. --> one step back
cd ../.. --> two steps back
every system has a man command which tells information about the command to 
access the information we need write man commandName;
ls we can give the additional information like -l, etc these are called flags.
the ls -1 command gives information about the files, the ls -b command gives
information about the hidden files we can also write both information 
with "ls -1b"
rm rmdir rm -rf to remove files and folders

////////////////// git and github //////////////

git is a free and  open source version control system.
where it helps us to track changes in our code.
it is a opensource that means it is avilable to everyone to make 
changes in the main code of git .
many companys uses the git and it helps to collabrate with our team mates it helps us to see 
who written the which line and who wrote all the code in team and what changes made in the code;
who changed the code.
track changes means we have written some code and we made changes in the code we can go to 
the back code and delete unnecessary code using git

github is a website where we host respiratories or repos(folders/projects) online
we can post the projects in the github 


readme is a file which has the information about our file like which language you used and about
the project and the good practice is to create a readme file 
it is saved with md name extension means mark down

comit means we changed something in the git
we can add means change but the commit means the saving the changes. that means we write a letter 
it is called change and we made a stamp is called commit

we use git in the terminal becuase when we use the terminal for git we can learn about the 
terminal easily there are different ways and like vscode and gui but the terminal is popular it is
faster than others and also we can make the complex items in terminal 


git config --global user.name"My name";
git config --global user.email"someemail";
the above configure options means by which name do we want to make changes in the files
there is option local also in the place global . global means it uses the same name throughout 
the computer/system.
there is a command git config --list. it(the command) lists all the username email 
we can get the git hub files into our device using the git clone command the github has some links on that 
links the http link are best for the beginners.
when we make changes in a github readme files in a vscode . the vscode tells us to commit the changes
in the github properly. the clone command makes the copy of the files.

git status
 it  is a command which is used to get the status of the files.
 there is a life cycle for the files . first the files are untracked that means the files which are not in 
 git. to track the changes save the file in git and then the file is unmodified . if we make any changes 
 then it is modified. if we save the changes then it is staged. then the changes are commited after the staged;

commit is a two step process.first we need to add the file and then we need to commit the
changes . currently we are in working directory if we add the files then the files goes into stagged
then we commit the changes to add all the changes the we will write "git add ." command or we can write
"git add filename" . if we want to commit the changes then we write "git commit -m 'some valid information about 
the files' ". then if we write the status we will get all are commited.
git push origin main ; origin means the file origin 


if we want to add new folder in our local computer we first go into the folder using terminal and run command
named git init it will add the folder into git .
if we want to add a new folder into the git we need to create the repository in the 
github then we need to paste the link of that repository
